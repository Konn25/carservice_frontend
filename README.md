# Car service frontend

I made a frontend for my car service backend (You can find it here: https://github.com/Konn25/carservice ). 

## You can:
 - Register and login user

 # How to run
    1) Firstly, download the backend from here https://github.com/Konn25/carservice

    3) Run the backend
    4) Then you need to navigate to the ***frontend*** project directory.
    5) Use the following command in the terminal ***ng-serve***
